# README: Basic Plots

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of **basic plots** for data visualization. The `Basic_plots.ipynb` notebook covers fundamental plotting techniques to represent data graphically in an intuitive manner.

## Features
- Generates **line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts**.
- Customizes plots with **titles, labels, legends, and color schemes**.
- Uses **Matplotlib and Seaborn** for effective visualization.
- Works with sample datasets for demonstration.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for data analysis and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive execution.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization.
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data handling.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Basic_plots.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells to generate different types of basic plots.
3. Modify dataset values and chart settings to experiment with visualization styles.
4. Use these plots to better understand and present data trends.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **interactive plots** using Plotly.
- Add **real-world datasets** for better analysis.
- Explore **advanced customization techniques** for publication-ready visuals.
- Combine multiple plots in a **dashboard-style visualization**.
